# Elixir for Programmers - Course follow-along

The code contained in this repo is the result of following along with the [Elixir for Programmers (2nd ed.)](https://codestool.coding-gnome.com/courses/elixir-for-programmers-2) by [Dave Thomas](https://pragdave.me). Many thanks to him for creating an awesome resource for getting to know Elixir and Phoenix. Especially appreciated are his way of separating implementation and runtime concerns as well as working with separate projects to build a maintainable and flexible system.

Very minor differences exist to the course's code. If you run into any troubles running the tests, the blame lies squarely with me for making those changes and not verifying that the code still works. Check the code provided with the course when in doubt.
